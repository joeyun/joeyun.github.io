            <p>My name is Sangmin Yun and I am a senior at Umass Amherst. I am a BDIC Informatics/Data Science major with an IT Minor and a strong passion for UI Design. </p>
            <p>I work a lot in Adobe Illustrator to create desigsns for either UI or freelance logo work. My design style relies heavily on minimalism and simplicity while incorporating trendy modern designs.
            </p>
            <p>Aside from education, I enjoy simple pass times like finding new music, designing logos, going on unhealthy netflix binges, and trying new things!</p>
