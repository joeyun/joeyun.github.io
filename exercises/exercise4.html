        <p>Goten of Japan is a Japanese hibachi restaurant with a sushi bar based in Sunderland MA. I worked there for about 4 years in highschool and only recently looked at their website. At first glance, it is hard to navigate through their site and is not very user friendly. It is a bit hard to find certain things that a customer would find important like, menu, services, specials, etc. I think the biggest issue with their site is lack of consistency across pages and not having a very common-knowledge structure to the layout of the overall site.</p><br>
        
    <h2>New Books Network website</h2>

        <p>Last year I took a junior year writing course with one of my all time favorite professors at Umass Amherst, Professor Marshall Poe. On his off time at Umass, he started and runs a company called, 'New Books Network'. This company creates audio podcasts of author interviews from new to well-known books. They are dedicated to raising the level of public discourse by introducing serious authors to a wide public via new media. I would want to give their website a new look to their website by using current design trends and more appealing visuals in their site.</p><br>
        
    <h2>Instagram website</h2>

        <p>Instagram is a largely used social media platform that runs on pictures/videos posted by its users. Their website is already very well designed obviously, but I have some ideas I'd like to try incorporating to enhance the experience of the Instagram website for its users. Currently, when opening the website, you are shown your feed and one issue that I personally have with it is that, the posts on the feed are very large and don't usually fit very well on the screen, sometime even cutting of some of the post. I beleive use of white space is good in certain designs but too much of it can be underwhelming and boring sometimes.</p><br>
