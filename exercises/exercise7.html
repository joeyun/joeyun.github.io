        <p><a class="button" href="pdf/Signup_UI.pdf" target="_blank">Sign-up Page (UI Design)</a><br> 
            There are countless web pages on the internet that have a sign-up page. There are many variations and styles of the sign-up page and I’ve found many to be a bit too complicated, long or just unappealing to look at. This is a user interface I designed for a clean and minimalistic sign-up page. It simply asks you for your name, email, and desired password. The user can then agree to the terms and conditions and sign up or if they are already a member, can simply click the “I’m already a member” button conveniently located next the sign-up button.</p>

        <p><a class="button" href="pdf/Checkout_UI.pdf" target="_blank">Checkout Page (UI Design)</a><br> 
            This a simple user interface design of a checkout page. Most checkout pages are simply just a page with a form that allows the users to enter payment information and checking out their items in their cart. This design splits the screen into two sections and allows users to see the items in their car that they are checking out. It provides the users with a rotatable gallery of the items in the cart along with the individual and total prices of the items on the bottom left. On the right side, the users can enter their payment information and click purchase or have the option to pay with PayPal.</p>

        <p><a class="button" href="pdf/IBM_UI.pdf" target="_blank">IBM Cloud Computing Landing Page (UI Design)</a><br>
            After looking at the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/cloud-computing" target="_blank">cloud computing landing page</a> of IBM’s website, I thought I’d take the time to simply redesign their page to be more visually appealing and interesting for users by taking a more modern and minimalistic approach. Using current design trends like vivid colors, gradients, high contrast, minimalistic designs/icons, and lots of white space, I put together this new design for IBM.</p>

        <p><a class="button" href="pdf/AllLogos(BW).pdf" target="_blank">Logo Designs</a><br>
            These are a series of logo designs I created on my free time to enhance my design skills. Some of these logos were freelance work and others were out of creative boredom. Creating many logos allowed me to explore different styles and techniques in design and try out different design trends. This helped me learn design software such as Adobe Illustrator in detail and furthered my passion for design. I was even lucky enough to sell one of these logos for a few hundred dollars.</p>
